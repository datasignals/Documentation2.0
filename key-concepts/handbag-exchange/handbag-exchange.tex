\begin{abstract}
\noindent This paper outlines how Lockular could use it's NFT Marketplace platform to run a luxury handbag service.
This service would focus on the buying and resale of luxury handbags with a full provenance record. A handbag servicing capability
would also be offered and indeed the service forming part of the provenance record.

Smart water is considered as a means of tieing the physical handbag with the provenance record.

\section{Handbag Service}\label{sec:page-layout}
The service is offered as a website with social media as the main the marketing channels. Relationships will need building with the
luxury handbag manufacturers and the recruitment of knowledgable staff members in respect of the brand and also the crafts required to offer
a professional handbag servicing facility.

Offerings can be categorised into three main areas: buying, selling, and servicing luxury handbags. Here's a brief overview of what
would be offered:

\subsection{Buy Preloved Bags}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shop All: A wide selection of luxury handbags from top brands like Chanel, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Dior, and more.
    \item Collections: Includes various categories such as Vintage Finds, Luxe Finds Under Â£300, Brand New, and Trending Now.
    \item Shop by Brand: Featuring a comprehensive list of luxury brands.
    \item Shop by Popular Styles: Classic Chanel, Hermes Kelly, Dior Saddle, and more.
    \item Categories: Handbags, Purses/Wallets, Luggage, Backpacks, Briefcases, Accessories, Vintage, Care Products, and Gift Vouchers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sell My Bag}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Online Quote: Offers an online quote for selling Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Hermes, and other branded bags.
    \item Selling Process: Built on an NFT Marketplace infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Service My Bag}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cleaning and Restoration Quote: Offers quotes for various types of repairs and restorations, including bag repair, belt repair,
    wallet repair, purse repair.
    \item Restoration Services: Detailed restoration services like cleaning and protection, restoring signs of wear, colour change and
    customisations, hardware and zip replacement, and more.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Provenance Service}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Authenticate: Authentication services to guarantee the authenticity of the luxury bags from manufacture and throughout owner history.
\end{itemize}

\section{NFT Marketplace}\label{sec:page-layout}
An NFT Marketplace will form the basis for the buy, sell, service functionality, offered via a web app. The web app must be high end, highly robust
web app that works well on mobile as it's primary target.
\marginnote{See the paper on Smart Contract based NFT Marketplaces with Multi-Sig}

Individual handbags will need to be tied in as an NFT using a unique identifier. Here we propose the use of a SmartWater product to mark each handbag
at the point of manufacture or at the point of a validated purchase.

\subsection{SmartWater}\label{sec:page-layout}
\marginnote{See the wiki page on SmartWater: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmartWater}
The SmartWater solution is designed to be applied to valuable items. It consists of a liquid containing a code that can be detected under
ultraviolet light. SmartWater comes in three variants:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Index Solutions: A water-based solution with low-level additives, used in spray systems activated by intruder detection units.
    \item Indsol Tracer: A polymer emulsion that blends different chemical agents according to a binary code, allowing for billions of possibilities.
    \item SmartWater Instant: Mainly consists of a copolymer of vinyl acetate in isopropyl alcohol, containing millions of tiny fragments with a unique
    identification number.
\end{itemize}
At the point registering the handbag with the service the liquid fingerprint is applied to the item.

\section{Benefits}\label{sec:page-layout}
Integrating SmartWater technology into luxury handbags to provide them with a unique identifier, and then representing these handbags as NFTs
(Non-Fungible Tokens) in an NFT marketplace, will enhance the provenance and authenticity verification process for these items.
This approach combines physical asset marking with blockchain technology to offer a robust solution for verifying the authenticity and
ownership history of luxury handbags. Here's how this integration impacts the provenance rigour:

\subsection{Enhanced Provenance Verification}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unique Physical-Digital Link: SmartWater's unique identifier acts as a bridge between the physical handbag and its digital representation as an NFT.
    This link ensures that the digital token on the blockchain corresponds to a specific, physical item.
    \item Immutable Record: Blockchain technology provides an immutable record of all transactions associated with the NFT, including creation, transfers of
    ownership, and any other relevant events. This digital ledger offers a transparent and tamper-proof history of the handbag's provenance.
    \item Increased Security: The combination of SmartWater's forensic technology and blockchain's security features significantly reduces the risk of
    counterfeiting and unauthorised duplication. It becomes much harder for counterfeit goods to enter the market when each genuine handbag has a verifiable,
    unique identifier and a corresponding NFT.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Deterrence of Theft and Counterfeiting}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Theft Deterrence: Knowing that a handbag is marked with SmartWater and represented as an NFT could deter potential thieves, as the item's provenance
    can be easily traced, making it difficult to sell stolen goods.
    \item Counterfeit Reduction: Counterfeiters would find it challenging to replicate the unique SmartWater identifier and the corresponding NFT, reducing
    the prevalence of fake luxury handbags in the market.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Market Confidence}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consumer Trust: Buyers can verify the authenticity and ownership history of a handbag through its NFT, increasing confidence in secondary market
    transactions.
    \item Value Retention: Handbags with verifiable provenance and authenticity are likely to retain their value better over time, appealing to collectors
    and investors.  
\end{itemize}

\section{Market Adoption}\label{sec:page-layout}
Widespread adoption by manufacturers, sellers, and buyers is crucial for this system to effectively enhance the provenance of luxury handbags.
Launching a service that integrates SmartWater technology with NFTs for luxury handbags and promoting market adoption involves a multifaceted approach.
Key considerations for a successful launch and promotion:
\subsection{Partnerships and Collaborations}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Luxury Brands: Secure partnerships with luxury handbag manufacturers to integrate SmartWater technology during the manufacturing process.
    \item NFT Marketplaces: Design and implement a bespoke marketplace contract tailored for luxury handbags.
    \item Authentication Experts: Work with experts in luxury handbag authentication to ensure the service's credibility.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Technology Development}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Blockchain Infrastructure: Utilise Lockular's existing blockchain platform that supports NFTs, where it is known to be secure, scalable,
    and capable of handling transactions efficiently.
    \item SmartWater Integration: Create a seamless process for applying SmartWater to handbags and linking the unique identifier to the corresponding NFT.
    \item User Interface: Design an intuitive web and mobile platform that makes buying, selling, and verifying handbags straightforward for users.

    \item Anti-Counterfeiting Measures: Work with legal experts to ensure the service meets all legal requirements for anti-counterfeiting measures.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Marketing and Promotion}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Brand Positioning: Position the service as a premium offering that enhances the value and security of luxury handbags.
    \item Social Media Strategy: Develop a comprehensive social media strategy targeting luxury goods enthusiasts. Platforms like Instagram, Pinterest,
    and YouTube are ideal for showcasing the beauty and uniqueness of the handbags, as well as explaining the technology and its benefits.
    \item Influencer Partnerships: Partner with fashion influencers and luxury lifestyle bloggers to promote the service. Authentic endorsements can
    significantly boost credibility and reach.
    \item Content Marketing: Create engaging content that highlights the benefits of the service, including articles, videos, and infographics that explain
    how SmartWater and NFTs work to protect and authenticate luxury handbags.
    \item Community Engagement: Build a community around the brand by engaging with users on social media, hosting webinars or live QA sessions, and
    participating in luxury goods and blockchain technology forums.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Customer Education}\label{sec:page-layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Educational Content: Develop content that educates potential users about the importance of provenance and authenticity in the luxury handbag market.
    \item Demonstrations and Tutorials: Offer demonstrations and tutorials on how to verify the authenticity of handbags using the service. 
\end{itemize}
