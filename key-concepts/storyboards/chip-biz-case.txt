Leveraging Blockchain to gain deeper understanding of the materials inside your chips....the chip's Provenance

There are literally billions of transistors and component blocks being brought in from multiple places

Chip blocks can be from an open source community, where the provenance may not be clear

People might bring in a piece of a design for a chip block that has been made in China without anyone knowing what is in it

The problem is how do we know absolutely who worked on every design and every part design of a chip 

Lockular has a blockchain based solution that tracks and attributes design changes to each and every human involved

Lockular has a proof of concept deployed with Codasip and German RISC-V design tool vendor

Codasip provides Lockular's first route to market for the blockchain based solution

We are seeking investment to engage the chip community in support of a blockchain chip provenance data standard
