- Lockular's Provenance Tracking filesystem and it's intrinsic ability to secure file data and provide implicit provenance.
- Lockular's Workflow Actor Management system - a smart contract based RBAC dApp providing inter organisational team structure provenance.
- Lockular's NFT based Marketplace for design outputs like SDKs and IPBlocks
